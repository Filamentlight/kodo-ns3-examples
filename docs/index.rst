Welcome to the documentation of the Steinwurf Kodo with ns-3 examples
repository!

This set of documents provides a tutorial showing how to use Steinwurf C++
Kodo library together with the ns-3 simulator. Particularly, here we employ
C++ bindings for the library to ease the deployment of the examples. This
tutorial is designed as a starting point for developers that intend to use
the Kodo library for a specific application of Random Linear Network Coding
(RLNC) within the simulator.
