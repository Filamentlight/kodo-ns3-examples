Introduction
------------
As it concerns to the ns3-networkcoding repository, codes have been included which made the use of random linear network coding possible in a wireless systems. Before performing the implementation process, it is necessary to make some simulations and in order to do so, the ns3 simulator has been chosen.

ns-3 is a discrete-event network simulator for Internet systems, targeted primarily for research and educational use. ns-3 is free software, licensed under the GNU GPLv2 license.

Getting Started
---------------
The first step is to install ns3 in a local machine. Dependind on the operating system that is used, a set of steps must be follow which can be found in the following link: 

http://www.nsnam.org/wiki/index.php/Installation. 


Once ns3 is installed, some guides can be follow in order to become familiar with. 
In this case, it is going to be simulated network coding using ns3 as a library, then these steps can be skipped.


Moreover, the library kodo is used by code. In order to download and place the library kodo in the system, just follow this link:
