Introduction
------------
As it concerns to the ns3-networkcoding repository, codes have been included which made random linear network coding possible in wireless systems. Before performing the implementation process, it is necessary to make some simulations and in order to do so, the ns3 simulator has been chosen.
ns-3 is a discrete-event network simulator for Internet systems, targeted primarily for research and educational use. ns-3 is free software, licensed under the GNU GPLv2 license.

Getting Started
---------------
The first step is to install ns3 in a local machine. Dependind on the operating system that is used, a set of steps must be follow which can be found in the following link: http://www.nsnam.org/wiki/index.php/Installation. 


Once ns3 is installed, some guides can be follow in order to become familiar with. 
In this case, it is going to be simulated network coding using ns3 as a library, then these steps can be skipped.
